You mentioned people can make brackets. What happens if people predict some of the wins or maybe all of the wins? Owen Moore

I like how you showed what team won in the recent seasons and gave history about March Madness. Do you know if there were any crazy bets that people made on March Madness? Zane Jasmin

Fantastic work, Jaxon.  Even though I knew just about nothing about basketball, I was able to follow all of your blog, and understand why March Madness is so important!  It flowed very naturally. I think your ELA teacher would be proud of you. 
The only part that confused me was about the brackets ... but I suppose your audience knows all about that.
I think you misuse or underuse comments in places, and have a few other grammar issues.  Please paste this into a Google Doc and run a spell and grammar check, then paste back?  For a reader, little stumbles get in the way of the flow.
