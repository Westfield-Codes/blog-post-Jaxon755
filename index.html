   <h2>The Overview</h2>
   <p>March Madness, a tournament made up of 68 college teams hoping to make it all the way and win the NCAA Championship. The tournament constantly has upsets of the favored teams, causing it to be one of the greatest annual sporting events in the U.S. This 68-team format wasn't adopted until 2011, but it definitely made the tournament more interesting, giving more underdog teams a chance to win it all.</p>
 
   <h2>When and Where it Started</h2>
   <p>The idea started 86 years ago in 1939 by Harold Olsen, the coach of Ohio State at the time. This first ever tournament was won by Oregon, led by center Slim Wintermute, a 6 '8 shot-blocking machine. As the years went on, the tournament started to grow, adding more and more teams each year, which is where we are now with 68 teams competing in this widely known tournament, March Madness.</p>

   <h5>Uconn Winning March Madness in 2023</h5>
   <h2>How it Levels The Playing Field</h2>
   <p>The new addition of the 68 teams who otherwise would not be in the tournament because of their records gives these smaller, less-known teams a chance to beat the bigger teams and show that they're the same level or even better. Fans can enjoy these “Cinderella runs”, as people like to call them, where underdog teams that had no chance of winning find a way to pull it off. This is way better compared to when March Madness first started, when there were only 8 teams, and you wouldn't be surprised or engaged when one beat the other.</p>

   <h2>What Makes It Interesting.</h2>
   <p>People love to be able to fill out the bracket each year as a way to engage with the tournament. The thing that makes it so interesting though is the unpredictability. Multiple low-seed teams upset the best teams in the country, giving fans something to watch for when they see these underdog teams doing so well, which nobody could have predicted.</p>
   
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, this is a great tournament with an unpredictable nature and many die-hard fans are waiting to see if their team can win, and I hope you will tune in to watch the tournament whenever you can to enjoy its fascinating concept.</p>

                      <p>You mentioned people can make brackets. What happens if people predict some of the wins or maybe all of the wins?</p>

                      <p>Usually if you guess all of the wins correct you would win a ton of money if you decided to play your bracket online and bet on it. Although I dont think anybodys ever gotten a perfect bracket where all the wins were correct.</p>

                      <p>Fantastic work, Jaxon.  Even though I knew just about nothing about basketball, I was able to follow all of your blog, and understand why March Madness is so important!  It flowed very naturally. I think your ELA teacher would be proud of you. The only part that confused me was about the brackets ... but I suppose your audience knows all about that I think you misuse or underuse comments in places, and have a few other grammar issues.  Please paste this into a Google Doc and run a spell and grammar check, then paste back?  For a reader, little stumbles get in the way of the flow. </p>

                      <p>I dont know about the biggest bet ever placed on March Madness, but the biggest bet ever won was in 2021 by Bovada Sportsbook where they bet $8000 on the Baylor Bears to win and they did, which ended up making them $36,996.</p>
